# Star Trail CleanR, Version History

---

## v1.0-beta
A full rewrite. Everything below is new since v0.19-beta.

- Native desktop app (macOS and Windows), no more browser window
- New AI trail detector trained on thousands of real astrophotography frames, including a community dataset from gkyle
- Star Bridge repair that borrows clean pixels from the frames before and after, so removed trails blend in seamlessly
- Silent ground-only hot-pixel fix, cleans stuck and dead pixels on the landscape without touching the sky
- Dark mode and a proper tabbed interface
- Logo and banner across the top
- Mask Painter tool for editing the ground mask when you want manual control
- "Scrubbing the stars" run screen with live progress, time elapsed, trails swept, and an estimated time to finish
- End-of-run stats: total trails removed, total frames cleaned, total time, and an estimate of how much manual editing you just skipped
- JPG or TIF output with a JPEG quality slider
- Live frame count when you pick a folder
- All labels are selectable so you can copy paths, values, and numbers
- Have a suggestion? There's a mailto link in the About tab

## v0.19-beta
- Fixed "not open anymore" error on Mac when relaunching after closing the browser tab
- Improved time estimate accuracy for high-resolution cameras — a 36MP camera now shows a realistic estimate instead of the 20MP reference time
- Updated accepted file types label in the interface (.JPG, .TIF 8 & 16 bit)

## v0.18-beta
- Fixed batch count estimate — the "Est. batches" number now always matches the actual number of batches processed

## v0.17-beta
- Fixed relaunch on Mac: closing the browser tab and reopening the app now brings back the existing session instead of showing "application not open" error

## v0.16-beta
- Added 16-bit TIFF support — the app now correctly detects and processes 16-bit TIF files without removing stars
- Improved detection accuracy for high-resolution cameras (35MP, 45MP, etc.) — processing time and false detection counts now scale correctly with image size

## v0.15-beta
- Fixed Unicode crash on Windows when processing files with special characters in output
- Removed hardcoded Mac file paths that caused errors on other systems
- Improved placeholder text throughout the interface

## v0.14-beta
- Fixed Windows launch crash (WinError 10061) caused by port binding conflict on startup

## v0.13-beta
- Version number now displays automatically in the app title from the release tag
- Added resolution check — files with mismatched resolutions in the same folder are flagged and skipped
- General interface text improvements

## v0.12-beta
- Fixed file discovery — the app now accepts any image filename and extension (JPG, JPEG, PNG, TIF, TIFF), not just files named IMG_*.jpg

## v0.11-beta
- Fixed app crash when relaunching after closing — now uses a random port to avoid conflicts with the previous session

## v0.10-beta
- First public release
- Gradio web interface with folder browse, output folder, frame limit dropdown, and progress bar
- Live status updates during processing
- Opens output folder automatically when done
- Mac (Apple Silicon) and Windows builds
