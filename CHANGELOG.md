# Star Trail CleanR — Version History

---

## v0.19-beta
- Fixed "not open anymore" error on Mac when relaunching after closing the browser tab
- Improved time estimate accuracy for high-resolution cameras — a 36MP camera now shows a realistic estimate instead of the 20MP reference time
- Updated accepted file types label in the interface (.JPG, .TIF 8 & 16 bit)

## v0.18-beta
- Fixed batch count estimate — the "Est. batches" number now always matches the actual number of batches processed

## v0.17-beta
- Fixed relaunch on Mac: closing the browser tab and reopening the app now brings back the existing session instead of showing "application not open" error

## v0.16-beta
- Added 16-bit TIFF support — the app now correctly detects and processes 16-bit TIF files without removing stars
- Improved detection accuracy for high-resolution cameras (35MP, 45MP, etc.) — processing time and false detection counts now scale correctly with image size

- Fixed file discovery — the app now accepts any image filename and extension (JPG, JPEG, PNG, TIF, TIFF), not just files named IMG_*.jpg

## v0.11-beta
