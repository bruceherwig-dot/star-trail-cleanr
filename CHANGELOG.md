# Star Trail CleanR, Version History

---

## v1.5-beta
- **Update check on startup**: when a newer version of Star Trail CleanR is released, the app now shows a banner with a Download button. Clicking opens your browser to the download page. Nothing auto-installs; you stay in control.
- **Trail detector updates**: when a new trail detector is released, the app shows a card with the name, what's better, and credits to community contributors. Click Download to pull the new detector; it takes over on your next run. Click Not right now to skip for this launch.
- **Active detector shown in the header**: under the version number, the header now shows which Trail Detector is currently loaded (e.g., "Trail Detector 2").
- **New Windows installer for NVIDIA users**: the download page now offers a separate "Windows (NVIDIA GPU)" installer. If you have an NVIDIA graphics card, this version runs trail detection much faster than the standard installer. The regular Windows installer stays the default for everyone else.
- **New Mac installer for Intel users**: the download page now offers a separate "Mac (Intel)" installer for older Intel-based Macs. Apple Silicon users keep using the existing Mac Apple Silicon download.
- **Automatic hardware selection**: the app now picks the best available hardware at runtime. NVIDIA first if you have one, then Apple's fast-processing mode on Apple Silicon, then regular CPU. No setup needed.

## v1.4-beta
- Windows installer now ships inside a zip wrapper. Microsoft Edge was quarantining the unsigned installer with a Defender SmartScreen warning whose "Keep" option was buried in a hidden dropdown next to the "Delete" button, and most novice users never found it. Wrapping the installer in a zip sidesteps that gate entirely. Download the zip, right-click and choose "Extract All...", then double-click StarTrailCleanRSetup.exe inside the extracted folder. The familiar "Windows protected your PC" warning still appears at install time and is handled the same way ("More info" then "Run anyway"). Mac unchanged.

## v1.3-beta
- Stable download links: the Mac zip and Windows installer can now be linked from one permanent URL each, no more updating links every release.
- JPEG quality default raised from 80 to 95 to eliminate visible 8x8 block artifacts that showed up in the sky after stacking 100+ frames. Old default was inherited from web-image conventions and was wrong for star-trail stacking.
- End-of-run summary now reads "airplane and satellite trails" instead of just "airplane trails", which matches what the app actually removes.
- Resolution check is faster and quieter: no more "scanning 1/22, 2/22..." lines on every batch. The check happens once at the start of the run; batches just load straight into processing.
- "Loading YOLO model..." renamed to "Loading AI trail detector..." in the run log.

## v1.2-beta
- Windows now ships as a one-click installer instead of a raw zip. The new Setup file is a single .exe that installs the app to Program Files, creates a Start Menu shortcut, and registers a real uninstaller. No more 60,000-file Explorer extract.
- The installer is much smaller than the old zip thanks to LZMA2 compression.
- Mac unchanged for now. Mac handles the .app-in-zip cleanly because macOS treats the bundle as a single item.

## v1.1-beta
- Fixed a crash on Windows where the app tried to load the AI model from a local folder that doesn't exist on the tester's machine. The model is now bundled inside the app itself.

## v1.0-beta
A full rewrite. Everything below is new since v0.19-beta.

**Release-testing fixes (v1.006–v1.009):**
- Fixed a crash on first cleaning run caused by a missing math library in the frozen app
- Mask Painter: Back button now looks and behaves like a real button
- Mask Painter: cursor switches back to a normal arrow when you move off the image into the gray margin
- Mask Painter: zoom now anchors to the center of the view instead of the top
- Mask Painter: brush-size scroll step smoothed out so the brush grows at a sensible pace on trackpads and mice

**Main v1.0-beta features:**
- Native desktop app (macOS and Windows), no more browser window
- New AI trail detector trained on thousands of real astrophotography frames, including a community dataset from gkyle
- Star Bridge repair that borrows clean pixels from the frames before and after, so removed trails blend in seamlessly
- Silent ground-only hot-pixel fix, cleans stuck and dead pixels on the landscape without touching the sky
- Dark mode and a proper tabbed interface
- Logo and banner across the top
- Mask Painter tool for editing the ground mask when you want manual control
- "Scrubbing the stars" run screen with live progress, time elapsed, trails swept, and an estimated time to finish
- End-of-run stats: total trails removed, total frames cleaned, total time, and an estimate of how much manual editing you just skipped
- JPG or TIF output with a JPEG quality slider
- Live frame count when you pick a folder
- All labels are selectable so you can copy paths, values, and numbers
- Have a suggestion? There's a mailto link in the About tab

## v0.19-beta
- Fixed "not open anymore" error on Mac when relaunching after closing the browser tab
- Improved time estimate accuracy for high-resolution cameras — a 36MP camera now shows a realistic estimate instead of the 20MP reference time
- Updated accepted file types label in the interface (.JPG, .TIF 8 & 16 bit)

## v0.18-beta
- Fixed batch count estimate — the "Est. batches" number now always matches the actual number of batches processed

## v0.17-beta
- Fixed relaunch on Mac: closing the browser tab and reopening the app now brings back the existing session instead of showing "application not open" error

## v0.16-beta
- Added 16-bit TIFF support — the app now correctly detects and processes 16-bit TIF files without removing stars
- Improved detection accuracy for high-resolution cameras (35MP, 45MP, etc.) — processing time and false detection counts now scale correctly with image size

## v0.15-beta
- Fixed Unicode crash on Windows when processing files with special characters in output
- Removed hardcoded Mac file paths that caused errors on other systems
- Improved placeholder text throughout the interface

## v0.14-beta
- Fixed Windows launch crash (WinError 10061) caused by port binding conflict on startup

## v0.13-beta
- Version number now displays automatically in the app title from the release tag
- Added resolution check — files with mismatched resolutions in the same folder are flagged and skipped
- General interface text improvements

## v0.12-beta
- Fixed file discovery — the app now accepts any image filename and extension (JPG, JPEG, PNG, TIF, TIFF), not just files named IMG_*.jpg

## v0.11-beta
- Fixed app crash when relaunching after closing — now uses a random port to avoid conflicts with the previous session

## v0.10-beta
- First public release
- Gradio web interface with folder browse, output folder, frame limit dropdown, and progress bar
- Live status updates during processing
- Opens output folder automatically when done
- Mac (Apple Silicon) and Windows builds
